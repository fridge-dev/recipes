# GitHub Pages Recipe Website Build Session

## Project Overview
Built a minimal GitHub Pages website for personal cooking recipes, hosted from the `docs/` directory.

## Final Structure Created
```

├── _config.yml
├── _includes/
│   └── head.html
├── _layouts/
│   └── default.html
├── assets/
│   └── css/

└── recipes/
    ├── chocolate-chip-cookies.md
    ├── simple-pasta.md
    └── taco-hot-dish.md
```

## Key Configuration Files

### _config.yml
- Site title: "Recipes"
- Using minima theme
- Custom permalinks for recipes: `/:basename` (removes duplicate "recipes" from URLs)
- Jekyll plugins: jekyll-feed

### Custom Layout (_layouts/default.html)
- Minimal header with just site title linking to home
- No footer for clean appearance
- Uses custom head.html include

### Custom CSS (assets/css/style.scss)
- Imports minima theme
- Custom hr styling: light grey line with 1rem margin

### Index Page (index.md)
- Simple recipe list using Jekyll liquid tags
- Source code attribution at bottom

## Features Implemented
1. ✅ **Ultra-minimal design** - Clean header, no footer
2. ✅ **Clean URLs** - Recipes at `/recipe-name` instead of `/recipes/recipe-name`
3. ✅ **Custom horizontal rule styling** - Light grey with proper spacing
4. ✅ **Automatic recipe listing** - Index page auto-generates from recipes/ folder
5. ✅ **Custom CSS loading** - Added style.css link to head.html

## Features Considered But Not Implemented
- Interactive ingredient checkboxes (would require JavaScript/HTML, keeping markdown simple)
- Automatic section anchor links (jekyll-anchor-headings not supported by GitHub Pages)

## Sample Recipes Created
1. **Chocolate Chip Cookies** - Standard cookie recipe
2. **Simple Garlic Pasta** - Quick pasta dish
3. **Taco Hot Dish** - Layered casserole with ASCII diagram

## Technical Issues Resolved
1. **CSS not loading** - Added explicit link in head.html include
2. **HR styling not working** - CSS specificity issues resolved
3. **Double "recipes" in URLs** - Fixed with custom permalink configuration

## Troubleshooting Notes
- GitHub Pages has limited plugin support
- Custom CSS requires explicit loading via head.html
- Minima theme has CSS reset that requires overrides
- SCSS files processed automatically by Jekyll when in assets/css/

## URLs Structure
- Home: `myacct.github.io/recipes/`
- Recipes: `myacct.github.io/recipes/recipe-name`
- Source: `https://github.com/fridge-dev/recipes`

## Final Status
Website successfully deployed and functional with minimal, clean design as requested.
